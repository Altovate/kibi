# Kibi 4.4.2

Kibi extends Kibana 4.4.2 with data intelligence features; the core feature of
Kibi is the capability to join and filter data from multiple Elasticsearch
indexes and from SQL/NOSQL data sources ("external queries").

In addition, Kibi provides UI features and visualizations like dashboard
groups, tabs, cross entity relational navigation buttons, an enhanced search
results table, analytical aggregators, HTML templates on query results, and
much more.
