== Using Kibi in a Production Environment

Please read the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/4.1/production.html[Kibana in Production]
section in the Kibana manual for production best practices, especially
the *Controlling access* section.

Make sure to set the configuration file as readable only to the user running
the Kibi process as it may contain credentials in the database connection
strings; we also recommend to create a database user without write privileges
as they are not required by the system.
