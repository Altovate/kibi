== Bubble Diagram

The Bubble Diagram visualization displays series of data grouped into packed circles.

=== Bubble size

The radius of circles depends on the type of metric aggregations.

*Count*:: The {elastic-ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-valuecount-aggregation.html[_count_] aggregation returns a raw count of
the elements in the selected index pattern.
*Average*:: This aggregation returns the {elastic-ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-avg-aggregation.html[_average_] of a numeric
field. Select a field from the drop-down.
*Sum*:: The {elastic-ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-sum-aggregation.html[_sum_] aggregation returns the total sum of a numeric
field. Select a field from the drop-down.
*Min*:: The {elastic-ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-min-aggregation.html[_min_] aggregation returns the minimum value of a
numeric field. Select a field from the drop-down.
*Max*:: The {elastic-ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-max-aggregation.html[_max_] aggregation returns the maximum value of a
numeric field. Select a field from the drop-down.
*Unique Count*:: The {elastic-ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-cardinality-aggregation.html[_cardinality_] aggregation returns
the number of unique values in a field. Select a field from the drop-down.

=== Buckets Aggregations

The _buckets_ aggregations determine what information will come out in the diagram.

You can do a maximum of two aggregations at one time.
The first aggregation will create the parent circles, while the second aggregation will create the child circles.

Parent circles look slightly different to the children ones.
Parent circles have a thicker border and the label is written in bold.

The parents bubbles are divided by color.
If you do a subaggregation (children), you will see the bubbles divided by family.
Children are located near the parent and all have the same color.
Families are united. If you drag a bubble, all members of the family will drag along.

=== Options

In the diagram there are two options

*Show Parents*:: If checked parent bubbles are visible when doing the subaggregation.

*Enable Zoom*:: Enables zoom on the page. To use the zoom you have to use the mouse wheel.

=== Circles movements

All circles gravitate towards the center of the visualisation.

When you drag a circle, its family follows it.

When moving the mouse over a circle, detailed information is shown in a tooltip.

=== Filters

You can create filters by double-clicking on the bubbles.

When you double-click a child, you will asked to confirm the application of the filter on the filter bar.

Pressing `Apply Now` will set the filter and display the bubble itself and its parent.

When you double-click a parent, you will see the bubble itself and its family.
