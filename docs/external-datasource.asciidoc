[[external-datasources]]
== External datasources

Kibi provides visualizations and aggregations to integrate data from external
datasources; this section explains how to setup datasources and configure
<<datasource-queries, queries>> and <<datasource-templates, query templates>>.

=== Configuration

External datasources can be configured in the `kibi/config/kibi.yml` file.

Kibi provides support for the following datasources:

* SQLite
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* any SPARQL HTTP endpoint (tested with Openlink Virtuoso and Joseki)
* *experimental* JDBC support (tested with http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[H2]).

To enable query results caching, set the `datasource_enable_cache` parameter
to `true`; the cache size and max age (in milliseconds) can be set through the
`datasource_cache_size` and `datasource_cache_max_age` parameters.

A Kibi restart is required to apply configuration changes.

NOTE: Sample connection strings are included in the default configuration file
for each kind of datasource.

NOTE: Make sure to set the configuration file as readable only to the user running
the Kibi process as it may contain credentials in the database connection
strings.

[[entity-selection]]
=== Datasource entity selection

Entities stored in external datasources are identified by a URI:

- `sql://@TABLE@/@PKVALUE@` for entities stored in SQL datasource, where
`@TABLE@` represents a table name and `@PKVALUE@` a unique column value; e.g.
`sql://company/1`.

- `sparql://@URI@` for entities stored in triplestores, where `@URI@`
represents a uniform resource identifier;
e.g. `sparql://http://dbpedia.org/resource/California`.

As explained in the following sections, queries on external datasources can
extract variables from the selected entity URI; in order to allow the user
to select an entity, you must add an <<enhanced-search-results>> visualization
to a dashboard and configure at least one <<click-handlers, click handler>>
to select an entity.

Once the visualization is configured, clicking on the cell will display
a purple box in the filter bar, and the variables stored in the entity URI
will be available to queries and query templates.

The screenshot below shows the effect of clicking on a cell configured with an
entity selection handler; after selecting an entity, the _Company Info_
template viewer shows the information about the company fetched by a query.

To disable or cancel the selection, click on the icons displayed inside the
entity selection widget when the mouse is over it, as displayed in the
screenshot below:

[[datasource-templates]]
=== Query templates

You can define templates to format query results.

Kibi supports two template engines:

* http://jade-lang.com/[jade]
* http://handlebarsjs.com/[handlebars]

There are three pre-defined templates:

* _kibi-json-jade_: this template presents the query results as a pretty-printed
JSON object using the _jade_ engine. This is useful to test queries while
writing them.
* _kibi-table-jade_: this template displays the query results in a table,
using the _jade_ engine.
* _kibi-table-handlebars_: like _kibi-table-jade_, using the _handlebars_
engine instead.

You can define your own custom template by clicking on the _Settings / Templates_
tab.

Then, pick the engine you prefer and write the template; to see a preview,
click on the _save_ button and select a query from the list;
depending on the query you selected, the <<query-variables,_EntityURI_>> may
need to be set.

[[datasource-queries]]
=== Queries

Queries can be used to provide data to <<datasource-templates>>,
<<relational-column, tag>> and filter Elasticsearch documents.

To create a new query, click to the _"Settings/Queries"_ tab.

You need then to set the following fields to define a query:

* _Title_: the title of the query.
* _Datasource_: the name of a configured datasource.
* _Results query_: the query declaration.

You may also set a description for the query and one or more tags.

Below is an example configuration of a query on a SQL database
called *Top 50 companies (HR count)* that returns the Top 50 companies by
number of employees in a table called `company`.

image::images/external-sources/queries-editor-sql1.png["Configuration of a SQL endpoint",align="center"]

The preview section will display the results of the query as a table or as a
JSON object.

[[query-variables]]
==== Query variables:

One of the most useful features of queries is that it is possible to set some
of their parameters before execution by using datasource specific variables,
which can be set at runtime by configuring <<click-handlers, click handlers>>
in the <<enhanced-search-results>> visualization to select an entity.

Variable values are taken from the selected entity URI which has a different
format depending on the datasource type.

.SQL.

The following variables can be specified in queries on SQL datasources:

- _@TABLE@_: a table name
- _@PKVALUE@_: a value that identifies a record (e.g. a primary key value)

In order to view the results of the query, you have to specify an entity URI
manually in the field on the top right; the URI for SQL entities is
structured as follows:

----
sql://@TABLE@/@PKVALUE@
----

Below is an example of configuration for a query named *Company Info* using
both variables.

In the example, _@TABLE@_ is replaced with _company_, and _@PKVALUE@_ with
_company/amazon_ .

.SPARQL.

The following variables can be specified in queries on SPARQL datasources:

- _@URI@_: the URI of the entity selected by the user.

Below is an example configuration of a query named *Top 10 Properties for a Company*.
The *@URI@* variable will be replaced at runtime by the selected entity URI.

In order to view the results of the query, you have to specify an entity URI
manually in the field on the top right.

[[activation-query]]
==== Activation Query

An activation query can be specified to conditionally execute the results
query.

For example, if you have a table called _Vehicles_ but some of the queries are
only relevant to "Motorcycles" and not to "Cars", the activation query could
be used to determine if the results query should be executed when an entity in
_Vehicles_ by looking at its type.
If the query is not executed, any template or aggregator using the query
will be automatically disabled.

On SQL datasources, activation queries will trigger results query execution
when returning at least one record.

Example:

[source,sql]
SELECT id FROM Vehicles WHERE id='@PKVALUE@' AND vehicle_type='Motorcycle'


On SPARQL datasources, activation queries must be written using the _ASK_ form;
the corresponding results query will be executed only if the query has a
solution.

Example:

[source,sparql]
----
PREFIX vehicle: <http://ontologies.example.org/vehicle#>

ASK {
    <@URI@> a vehicle:Motorcycle
}
----

[[datasource-uses]]
=== Use cases

Once you've configured query templates and queries, you can use them
in the following visualizations:

- The <<enhanced-search-results>> visualization
- The <<templated-query-viewer>> visualization

It is also possible to use queries as aggregations as explained below.

[[external-query-terms-filter-aggregation]]
==== External query terms filters aggregation

The query results from an external data source can be used as an aggregation
in visualizations.

This allows to compute metrics on Elasticsearch documents _joined_ with query
results.

To use a query as an aggregation, select a bucket type and select
_External Query Terms Filter_ in the _Aggregation_ dropdown; then, click on
the _Add an external query terms filter_ button.

You can then configure how to join the query results with the Elasticsearch
documents by setting the following parameters:

- _Source query id_: the name of the query on the external datasource.
- _Source query variable_: the name of the variable in query results
which contains the first value used in the join.
- _Target field_: the name of the field in the target index which contains
the second value used in the join.

The aggregation will return only documents in the Elasticsearch index whose
target field value is equal to the source query variable value in at least
one of the results returned by the query; if _Negate the query_ is checked,
the aggregation will return only documents in the Elasticsearch index whose
target field value is not equal to any of the values of the source query
variable in the results returned by the query.

For example, the screenshot below show the configuration of a Data table
visualization with three aggregations based on external queries:

- A query that selects the labels of the competitors of the currently selected
company
- A query that selects the labels of all the companies which have a competitor
- A query that selects the id's of the top 500 companies by number of employees

If a query requires a selected entity, and no entity is selected, the
computed aggregation will return 0.

filter aggregation on a pie chart visualization:
