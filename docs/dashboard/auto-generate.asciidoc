== Autogenerate Dashboard

If you have selected fields (or used the `autoselect fields` feature) in **Discover**, you can click the image:images/discover/generate-dashboard-button.png[Generate Dashboard Button]
button to autogenerate a dashboard from those selected fields. 
This will create a new dashboard with visualizations selected to display the data in those fields.

First the generated dashboard details are shown and can be edited:

Here, you can edit the title of the new dashboard, choose whether to store the time with the dashboard 
(a time filter set on the dashboard will be stored and retrieved when the dashboard is reloaded).

If you wish to add a <<kibi_multi_chart, Multichart visualization>> to the dashboard, select the checkbox. 
Be aware that this can slow the generation of the dashboard.

=== Generate Dashboard Report

Clicking image:images/discover/auto-select-test-modal-ok-button.png[Generate Dashboard Modal OK Button] on the generated dashboard's details panel opens a panel showing the details of the visualizations to be
added to the dashboard:

Here, the visualizations to be applied to the dashboard are listed. You can choose whether or not to add them with the 
checkboxes on the left and you can also edit the automatically generated title of each visualization in the input boxes on the right.

Clicking on image:images/discover/auto-select-test-modal-ok-button.png[Generate Dashboard Visualizations Modal OK Button] here will save and generate your new dashboard...
