Dashboards can be organized in dashboard groups.

If the dashboard is associated with a saved search, the count of documents on the dashboard is displayed next to the dashboard name.
Two additional indicators that might be displayed are:

* _Filters/Queries indicator_ - the filter icon is displayed if there are any filter or query currently applied on the dashboard
* _Pruned joins indicator_ - a star symbol is displayed if any of the join operations was pruned.

In the left-hand dashboard panel, you can change the order of the dashboard groups and move dashboards between groups by dragging and dropping. 

Dashboard groups can be managed by clicking on the _Create new group_ icon in the dashboard panel, and by right clicking on the dashboard group name to get _Edit_ and _Delete_ options.

In edit, you can change the title of an existing group, set the icon to a custom image by inserting a URL or use a https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/[Font Awesome] icon.
