=== Working with Filters

When you create a filter anywhere in {kibi-name}, the filter conditions display in an oval under the search text
entry box:

Hovering on the filter oval displays the following icons:

image::images/filter/filter-allbuttons.png[]

Enable Filter image:images/filter/filter-enable.png[]:: Click this icon to disable the filter without removing it. You can
enable the filter again later by clicking the icon again. Disabled filters are displayed with a striped shaded color.

Pin Filter image:images/filter/filter-pin.png[]:: Click this icon to _pin_ a filter. Pinned filters persist across {kibi-name} tabs.
You can pin filters from the _Visualize_ tab, click on the _Discover_ or _Dashboard_ tabs, and those filters remain in
place.

NOTE: If you have a pinned filter and you are not seeing any query results, check that your current tab's index pattern is one
that the filter applies to. E.g. a filter `name:giovanni` will results in 0 results if pinned and therefore "dragged along"
to a dashboard whose underlying index does not have a `name` field, let alone a `giovanni` value. For this reason a good
pattern in {kibi-name} is to use _Dashboard Groups_ to group together dashboard which are based on the same underlying index.
In this case the user can safely pin and "drag along" a filter across dashboards in the same group.

Toggle Filter image:images/filter/filter-toggle.png[]:: Click this icon to _toggle_ a filter. By default, filters are inclusion
filters, and are displayed in green. Only elements that match the filter are displayed. To change this to an exclusion
filter, displaying only elements that _don't_ match, toggle the filter. Exclusion filters are displayed in red.

Remove Filter image:images/filter/filter-delete.png[]:: Click this icon to remove a filter entirely.
Custom Filter image:images/filter/filter-custom.png[]:: Click this icon to display a text field where you can customize the JSON
representation of the filter and specify an alias to use for the filter name:

You can use a JSON filter representation to implement predicate logic, with `should` for OR, `must` for AND, and `must_not`
for NOT:

        }
      },
