[partintro]
--
The Management application is where you perform your runtime configuration of
{kibi-name}, including both the initial setup and ongoing configuration of index
patterns, advanced settings that tweak the behaviors of {kibi-name} itself, and
the various "objects" that you can save throughout {kibi-name} such as searches,
visualizations, and dashboards.

This section is pluginable, so in addition to the out of the box capabitilies,
packs such as {kibi-name} Access Control and X-Pack can add additional management capabilities.
