The Management application is where you perform your runtime configuration of
Kibi, including both the initial setup and ongoing configuration of index
patterns, advanced settings that tweak the behaviors of Kibi itself, and
the various "objects" that you can save throughout Kibi such as searches,
visualizations, and dashboards.

This section is pluginable, so in addition to the out of the box capabitilies,
packs such as Kibi Access Control and X-Pack can add additional management capabilities.
