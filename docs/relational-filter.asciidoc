== Kibi Relational filter

Kibi adds a relational dimension to Kibana when browsing indexes,
allowing to _filter_ documents on a dashboard by showing only those that have
a relation with documents displayed in a different dashboard, possibly stored
in different indices.

The Kibi relational filter visualization allows to "pivot" from a dashboard
to another by creating a join between multiple indexes based on their
relations.

Relations are defined between index fields; for example, let's take the
following indexes:

[horizontal]
_Articles_:: an index containing articles; each document in the index has
a field called `companyid` that contains the ID of the company mentioned in the
article. The index is displayed on dashboard named `Articles`.
_Companies_:: an index containing information about companies; each document
in the index has a field called `id` that contains the ID of the company.
The index is displayed on a dashboard named `Companies`.

Using the Relational filter visualization, it is possible to configure a
relation between `Articles.company` and `Companies.name` and use it as a
filter on the Companies index.

The result is that it becomes possible to search specific articles in the
_Articles_ dashboard, then switch to the _Companies_ dashboard and see only
companies mentioned in _Articles'_ search results.

In the _Articles_ dashboard, the relation is displayed as a button which,
if configured properly, will display the number of documents in the _Companies_
dashboard related to the documents displayed in the _Articles_ dashboard.

The screenshot below shows the button for the relation described in the
example; there are 48 companies mentioned in the 234 articles currently
displayed:

Clicking on the button will switch to the _Companies_ dashboard and display
the 48 companies; the relational filter is displayed in the filter bar, as
displayed below:

The Kibi Relational filter visualization requires the Siren 2.0 plugin for
Elasticsearch, which is currently available as a pre-release in
`lib\es-filter-join.zip`; the plugin is compatible with Elasticsearch 1.6 and
1.7.

=== Configuration

Click on the _Add filter_ button to create a new filter in the visualization;
the filter is defined by the following parameters:

- _Button label_: the label of the button that will be displayed inside the
visualization, e.g. `Companies -->`.
- _Filter label_: the label of the filter that will be displayed in the
filter bar, e.g. `...mentioned in Articles`.
- _Source index_: the source index in the relation.
- _Source index type_: the source index document type.
- _Source field_: the source index field in the relation.
- _Target index_: the index to be joined with _Source index_.
- _Target field_: the field in the target index related to _Source field_.
- _Target index type_: the target index document type.
- _Target dashboard_: the dashboard on which the join filter will be applied
when clicking on the button.

The screenshot below shows the configuration of a relation between
`Articles` and `Companies`:

It is possible to define multiple relations in a single Kibi relational
filter visualization; the visualization will display only buttons applicable
to the currently displayed dashboard.

=== Usage

When clicking on a button in the Kibi Relational filter visualization,
the filters applied in the source dashboard are permanently merged with the
filters applied in the target dashboard.
