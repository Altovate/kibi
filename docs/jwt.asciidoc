== JWT authentication support [Enterprise Edition only]

This section offers an overview of how to integrate Kibi EE with the Search
Guard JWT authenticator when Kibi is embedded into an iframe by another
application.

Before enabling JWT support you should setup Kibi and Search Guard as described
in the <<searchguard_integration,Search Guard integration>> chapter and ensure
that it works as expected.

=== Pre requisites

[float]
==== Search Guard add-on
JWT authentication support require the installation of the commercial Search
Guard Kerberos JWT HTTP Authentication add-on; to install it, download the
correct jar for your Search Guard version from {searchguard-jwt-ref}[this page]
and copy it to the `plugins/search-guard-2` directory on each node, then
perform a rolling restart of the cluster.

[float]
==== Kibi proxy
It is required that Kibi and the container application are published on the
same domain to allow cross frame communication; this can be achieved by
implementing a proxy to Kibi in the container application routes or configuring
a reverse proxy on a path in the application server configuration.

[float]
==== JWT token issuance
The application that embeds Kibi is responsible for generating JWT tokens;
https://jwt.io/[jwt.io] provides a good overview of the technology, a browser
based debugging tool and a list of libraries for several platforms.

The {searchguard-ref}/blob/master/jwt.md[Search Guard documentation] provides an
overview of all the claims supported by the add-on and a list of all the
configuration options.

**The application must specify an expiration date claim (`exp`) to
avoid creating tokens with unlimited duration**.

=== Configuration

Once the add-on has been installed in the cluster, you need to modify
`sg_config.yml` file and upload it to the cluster using `sgadmin`; **if you are
using the Search Guard management API make sure to include only the
`sg_config.yml` in the sgadmin configuration directory or you will overwrite
internal users, actiongroups, roles and mappings defined through the API**

To enable JWT authentication over HTTP, you need to add a JWT authenticator
stanza to `searchguard.authc`; an example `sg_config.yml` follows:

[source,yaml]
----
searchguard:
  dynamic:
    http:
      anonymous_auth_enabled: false
      xff:
        enabled: false
    authc:
      jwt_auth_domain:
        enabled: true
        order: 1
        http_authenticator:
          type: jwt
          challenge: false
          config:
            signing_key: "cGFzc3dvcmQ="
            jwt_header: "Authorization"
        authentication_backend:
          type: noop
     basic_internal_auth_domain:
        enabled: true
        order: 2
        http_authenticator:
          type: basic
          challenge: true
        authentication_backend:
          type: internal
----

With the above configuration, Search Guard will check if the `Authorization`
header contains a JWT token signed with the signing key specified in
`http_authenticator.signing_key`.

The signing key must be encoded using the `base64` algorithm; in the example
above the decoded key is `password`.

If the token is decoded successfully, Search Guard will validate the following
claims:

- `iat` - Issued At: the date when the token was issued (optional).
- `exp` - Expiration Time: the date after which the token should expired; this
  claim is optional but it is recommended to set it, otherwise tokens will have
  unlimited duration.
- `nbf` - Not Before: the date before which the token should be rejected (optional).

NOTE: All dates are expressed as seconds since the Epoch in UTC.

If time claims are validated, Search Guard will get the username from the
Subject claim (`sub`), assign role mappings and evaluate role permissions.

If an HTTP request to the cluster contains an HTTP Basic authorization header
it will be authenticated by the HTTP authenticator defined in
`basic_internal_auth_domain`; it is necessary to leave this enabled as the Kibi
backend uses this method to authenticate with the cluster.

[float]
===== Roles

It is possible to specify user roles in a token claim by setting the
`roles_key` attribute in the authenticator configuration to the desired claim
name, e.g.:

[source,yaml]
----
#...
      jwt_auth_domain:
        enabled: true
        order: 1
        http_authenticator:
          type: jwt
          challenge: false
          config:
            roles_key: "roles"
            signing_key: "cGFzc3dvcmQ="
            jwt_header: "Authorization"
#...
----

Once the attribute is set and the configuration is updated, it is possible to
assign backend roles to the user by setting the claim defined in
`http_authenticator.config.roles_key` in the token payload, e.g. :

[source,json]
----
{
  "sub": "kibiuser",
  "exp": 1495711765,
  "roles": "sales,marketing"
}
----

Please note that in order to map roles set in the JWT token to Search Guard
roles you will need to define a role mapping such as the following:

._JWT role mapping_

=== Verification

To verify that Search Guard JWT authentication is working correctly
you can generate a JWT token from your application and pass it to
Elasticsearch using curl's `-H` option, e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
curl -k -H "Authorization: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJraWJpdXNlciJ9.tqCYxJsORvro59Q01J9HUeFpQtauc81CcTlS5bVl93Y" https://localhost:9200/_searchguard/authinfo
----

To test if it is working correctly before the application is ready,
you can use the https://jwt.io/#debugger[jwt.io debugger] to generate
tokens using the signing key defined in `sg_config.yml`.

=== Kibi configuration

To enable JWT support in Kibi, set the
`kibi_access_control.backends.searchguard.authenticator` option to
`http-jwt`, in `kibi.yml` e.g.:

[source,yaml]
----
kibi_access_control:
  #... existing options
  backends:
    searchguard:
      #... existing options
      authenticator: 'http-jwt'
----

Then restart Kibi and open it in a browser; you should get a blank page and the
URL should end with `login`.

To test JWT authentication, open your browser console (`CTRL+SHITF+I` on Chrome
and Firefox) and call `setJWTToken` of the `kibi` object, e.g.:

[source,javascript]
----
.kibi
.setJWTToken(yourtoken)
.then(function() {
  console.log('JWT token set.');
})
.catch(function(error) {
  console.log('An error occurred setting the token.');
});
----

Once the token is set, Kibi will store it in an encrypted cookie and send
it in every request to the backend; the backend will then forward the
JWT token to Search Guard to authenticate the user.

After the token is set, you can switch to the desired Kibi URL by
simply changing `location.href`.

When the user is logged out from the main application, sessionStorage and
localStorage should be cleared.

For more information on how to call setJWTToken from the parent frame, please
refer to the <<cross_frame_communication,cross frame communication>> section.
