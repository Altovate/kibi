=== Install Kibi on Windows

Kibi can be installed on Windows using the `.zip` package;
zip packages can be downloaded from the {download-ref}[download page];
the demo versions contain a pre-configured Elasticsearch cluster in addition to
Kibi.

[[windows-running]]
==== Running Kibi from the command line

Kibi can be started from the command line as follows:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
.\bin\kibi
--------------------------------------------

By default, Kibi runs in the foreground, prints its logs to `STDOUT`,
and can be stopped by pressing `Ctrl-C`.

[[windows-configuring]]
==== Configuring Kibi via config file

Kibi loads its configuration from the `config/kibi.yml`
file by default.  The format of this config file is explained in
<<settings>>.

[[windows-layout]]
==== Directory layout of `.zip` archive

The `.zip` package is entirely self-contained.

This is very convenient because you don't have to create any directories to
start using Kibi, and uninstalling Kibi is as easy as removing the directory.
However, it is advisable to change the default locations of the config and data
directories so that you do not delete important data later on.
