=== Install {kibi-name} on Windows

{kibi-name} can be installed on Windows using the `.zip` package;
zip packages can be downloaded from the {download-ref}[download page].
The demo versions contain a pre-configured Elasticsearch cluster in addition to
{kibi-name}.

[[windows-running]]
==== Running {kibi-name} from the Command Line

{kibi-name} can be started from the command line as follows:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
.\bin\kibi
--------------------------------------------

By default, {kibi-name} runs in the foreground, prints its logs to `STDOUT`,
and can be stopped by pressing `Ctrl-C`.

[[windows-configuring]]
==== Configuring {kibi-name} via Config File

{kibi-name} loads its configuration from the `$KIBI_HOME/config/siren.yml`
file by default. The format of this config file is explained in
<<settings>>.

[[windows-layout]]
==== Directory Layout of `.zip` Archive

The `.zip` package is entirely self-contained.

This is very convenient because you do not have to create any directories to
start using {kibi-name}, and uninstalling {kibi-name} is as easy as removing the directory.
However, it is advisable to change the default locations of the config and data
directories so that you do not delete important data later on.
