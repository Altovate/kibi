Once you have selected at least one field, you can then select the image:images/discover/generate-dashboard-button.png[Generate Dashboard button] button to begin autogenerating a new <<dashboard, Dashboard>>. 

If you have not selected any fields, you can allow {kibi-name} to select the fields it believes are the most relevant by clicking the image:images/discover/auto-select-button.png[Remove Field button] button.

Note: This button is only visible if there are no fields selected. If you have selected fields, the image:images/discover/generate-dashboard-button.png[Generate Dashboard button] button will be visible in its place.

=== Autoselect Fields

{kibi-name} begins testing the fields with each field being analyzed for relevance against
a number of heuristics, for example, whether all values are unique - which indicates a potential ID field and unlikely to be relevant for visualizations.

Once all the fields have been analyzed, a test report is displayed.

This report shows all the fields in the Discover data, which fields are selected as most relevant, the field type, 
the visualization selected for that type, the relevancy score and any notes on why the field was or wasn't selected as a relevant field.

You can add and remove fields you would like selected using the checkboxes on the left. 

Once you are ready, hit the image:images/discover/auto-select-test-modal-ok-button.png[Autoselect Test Modal OK Button] button to select the fields.

Once the fields have populated the **Selected Fields** list, you are ready to <<autogenerate-dashboard, image:images/discover/generate-dashboard-button.png[Generate Dashboard button]>>.
