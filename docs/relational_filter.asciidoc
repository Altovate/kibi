{kibi-name} allows you to _filter_ documents on a dashboard by showing only those that
have a relation with documents displayed in a different dashboard, possibly
stored in different indices.

[[relational_filter]]
== Relational filter

The relational filter visualization allows to "pivot" from a dashboard
to another by creating a join between multiple indices based on their
relations. This allows to interactivelly build the sequence of dashboards to join.

The relational filter visualization is configured based on the <<kibi-settings-relations,relationships>> between indices defined in the settings tab.
For example, let's take the following indices:

[horizontal]
_article_:: an index containing articles; each document in the index has a field called `companies` which is an array that contains the ID of companies mentioned in the article. This index is displayed on the dashboard entitled `Articles`.
_company_:: an index containing information about companies; each document in the index has a field called `id` that contains the ID of the company. This index is displayed on the dashboard entitled `Companies`.

Both indices are <<kibi-settings-relations,configured>> so that they are joined on the field `companies` of `article` with the field `id` of `company`. Then, it is possible to use that configuration in order to create a relational filter that would filter companies based on connected articles (or vice-versa).

In the _Articles_ dashboard, the relational filter visualization is displayed as a button which indicates the number of documents in the _Companies_ dashboard that are mentioned in the articles of the current dashboard.

The screenshot below shows the button for the relation described in the example; there are 18011 companies mentioned in the 602,000 articles currently displayed:

Clicking on the button will switch you to the _Companies_ dashboard and display the 18011 companies; the relational filter is displayed in the filter bar, as displayed below:

The relational filter visualization requires the {federate-website}[Siren Federate plugin {federate-version}]
for Elasticsearch.

[[relational_filter_config]]
=== Configuration

Click on the _Add filter_ button to create a new filter in the visualization;
the filter is defined by the following parameters:

* _Button label_: the label of the button that will be displayed inside the visualization, e.g. `Companies -->`.
* _Custom filter label_: the label of the filter that will be displayed in the filter bar, which by default is `... related to ($COUNT) from $DASHBOARD.`. Several variables are available for customizing the label:
** $COUNT is a number of items on source dashboard,
** $DASHBOARD is a source dashboard name.
* _Source dashboard_: optional parameter that indicates on which dashboard the relational filter should appear in.
* _Target dashboard_: the dashboard to join the current dashboard with. The current dashboard is equal to the previous field if set.
* _Relation_: the label of the relation between indices to use for this relational filter. This is set in the <<kibi-settings-relations,relations>> settings tab.

The screenshot below shows the configuration of a relation from the `Articles` dashboard to the `Companies` dashboard, using the `mentions` relation:

It is possible to define multiple relations in a single {kibi-name} relational
filter visualization; the visualization will display only buttons applicable
to the currently displayed dashboard.

[[relational_filter_usage]]
=== Usage

When clicking on a button in the relational filter visualization,
the current state of the source dashboard is added to the relational filter
and applied to the target dashboard.
Just move the mouse over relational filter to see an explanation of what is being joined.

==== Walkthrough example

We start on the **Articles** dashboard, search for `pizza` and click on the relational filter to switch to the **Companies** dashboard.

image::images/relational_filter/example_1.png["Relational filter explanation",align="center"]

Hovering over the blue filter displays an explanation. It indicates that the relational filter involves only one join, i.e., the one from `Articles` to `Companies` with `pizza` filtering the articles.

image::images/relational_filter/example_2.png["Relational filter explanation",align="center"]

Next, we add a regular filter to the `Companies` dashboard by clicking on the image:images/PositiveFilter.jpg["Positive Filter"] in the `USA` row of the `Companies by Country` visualization.

image::images/relational_filter/example_3.png["Relational filter explanation",align="center"]

Now, we click on the `Investment rounds -->` button which takes us to the `Investment rounds` dashboard.
The explanation on that filter shows that the investment rounds are filtered as follows:

- the current investments rounds are joined with companies from the USA; and
- those companies are joined with articles which match the term `pizza`.

NOTE: The sequence of the joins in the explanation are shown in reverse, i.e., the last join is on top.

[[relational-filter_viewing-detailed-information]]
=== Viewing Detailed Information

To display the raw data behind the visualization, click the image:images/spy-open-button.png["Spy Open Button"] at the bottom left of the container. Tabs with detailed
information about the raw data replace the visualization, as in this example:

image::images/relational_filter/spy.png["Spy panel of the relational filter visualization",align="center"]

This panel provides two kinds data: information about the query behind the relational filter in the `Multi Search` tab, and details about the visualization object in the `Debug` tab.

[float]
==== Multi Search

This pane presents information about the {elastic-ref}/search-multi-search.html[msearch] request executed to perform the joins. A relational filter corresponds to one query of the msearch.

On the top, the time reported in `Multi search request duration` informs on how long the msearch request took. There is also additional information about each query of the msearch:

- _Query Duration_: The time spent for this particular query.
- _Hits_: the total number of documents resulting from the query.
- _Index_: the index pattern used to execute the query.
- _Type_: the type of the indices matched by the index pattern.

For a particular relational filter, you can get additional information about the query that got executed.

.Filterjoin
This displays a table that provides several statistics about each join.

image::images/relational_filter/spy_filterjoin.png["Details about the filterjoin query",align="center"]

.Raw Request
The filterjoin query as sent by {kibi-name}. This uses the internal API for defining the join.

.Translated Request
The filterjoin query as sent to the Elasticsearch cluster, presented in JSON format.

.Response
The raw response from the server, presented in JSON format.

[float]
==== Debug

The Debug tab presents the JSON object that {kibi-name} uses for this relational filter.

image::images/relational_filter/spy_debug.png["Debug spy panel of the relational filter visualization",align="center"]

[float]
==== Join Limit
The number of unique values returned from the `source` of the relation is limited by the `kibi:joinLimit` Advanced Setting in the management section.
These `source` values are then used to filter the documents on the `destination`. In general, the `destination` is the current dashboard.


For more on this and how to set the limit for each relation individually, see the <<kibi-join-limit,Join Limit>> section of the Relation Panel documentation.
