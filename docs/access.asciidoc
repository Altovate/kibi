== Accessing Kibi

Kibi is a web application that you access through port {kibi-default-port}. All you need to do is point your web browser at the
machine where Kibana is running and specify the port number. For example, `{start-url}` or
`http://YOURDOMAIN.com:{kibi-default-port}`.

When you access Kibi, the <<discover,Discover>> page loads by default with the default index pattern selected. The
time filter is set to the last 15 minutes and the search query is set to match-all (\*).

If you don't see any documents, try <<set-time-filter, setting the time filter>> to a wider time range.
If you still don't see any results, it's possible that you don't *have* any documents.

=== Checking Kibi Status

You can reach the Kibi server's status page by navigating to `{start-url}/status`. The status page displays
information about the server's resource usage and lists the installed plugins.
