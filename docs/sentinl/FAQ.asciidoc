[[q-is-siren-alert-a-watcher-clone]]
Q: Is SIREN ALERT a Watcher clone?

SIREN ALERT is not a Watcher clone per-se, but it does share generic
concepts and configuration style with Elastic Watcher to ease the pain
of users migrating between the two solutions and could potentially be
used to manage Elastic Watcher alerts.

SIREN ALERT is a Siren Investigate application and its core scheduler
runs within the Siren Investigate/Kibana server and is controlled with a
dedicated UI, while Elastic Watcher is a head-less, Elasticsearch plugin
and runs inside of Elasticsearch _(and requires a commercial license to
function past trial)_

Q: Emails are not being sent - Why? 

SIREN ALERT uses the `emailjs` npm module to ship out emails. The module requires a correct
message formed, so make sure your configuration includes a valid FROM
and TO as well as proper authentication method for your mail relay. In
case of doubts, please refer to the
https://github.com/eleith/emailjs[documentation]

[[q-reports-are-not-being-generated---why]]
Q: Reports are not being generated - Why?

SIREN ALERT uses the `node-horseman` npm module to control `PhantomJS`
at the core of this feature. The module requires `PhantomJS` being
pre-installed on the system running KaaE and Reports.

[[q-can-i-disable-a-watcher-without-deleting-it]]
Q: Can I disable a watcher without deleting it?

Sure! Just set watcher parameter `_source.disable: true` and SIREN ALERT
will bypass it entirely.

[[q-how-many-concurrent-watcher-can-siren-alert-handle]]
Q: How many concurrent watcher can SIREN ALERT handle?

SIREN ALERT relies on Elasticsearch search thread pool. By default, it
is 1000 concurrent requests (if server hardware is powerful enough),
also this value can be configured. Thus theoretically, by default, we
can support 1000 watchers running at the same time.

[[q-watchers-are-not-running-in-my-timezone---why]]
Q: Watchers are not running in my timezone - Why?

SIREN ALERT uses the UTC timezone internally to execute schedule - While
rolling watchers are not effected _(every x minutes)_ UTC timezone will
be used for absolute timed executions. Future versions will allow
adapting to localTimezone of the server executing Kibana/Siren
Investigate.

[[q-how-can-i-avoid-string-encoding-in-mustache-templates-output]]
Q: How can I avoid string encoding in mustache templates output?

When using mustache templates, all variables are HTML escaped by
default. If you want to return unescaped HTML, use the triple mustache:
\{\{\{name}}}. You can also use & to unescape a variable: \{\{& name}}.
This may be useful when changing delimiters (see
https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html[documentation])

[[q-how-can-i-use-siren-alert-with-readonlyrest-authentication]]
Q: How can I use SIREN ALERT with readonlyRest authentication?

When using `readonlyRest`, the following SIREN ALERT exceptions should
be added to its configuration:

....
- name: ALLOWPOST
  type: allow
  methods: [POST,HEAD,GET,DELETE,OPTIONS]
  uri_re:  ^/watcher_alarms-.*/
  hosts: [localhost] 
  verbosity: info

- name: ALLOWHEAD
  type: allow
  methods: [POST,HEAD,GET,DELETE]
  uri_re:  ^/watcher.*/
  hosts: [localhost] 
  verbosity: info
....

[[q-how-can-i-use-siren-alert-with-searchguard-authentication]]
Q: How can I use SIREN ALERT with SearchGuard authentication?

Here's an example provided by our Community to use SIREN ALERT +
SearchGuard. <<sentinl-search-guard, Full demo configuration>>.

1.  Edit the `sg_kibana_server` role in sg_roles.yml: ```
sg_kibana_server: cluster:
* CLUSTER_MONITOR
* CLUSTER_COMPOSITE_OPS indices: '?kibana': '*':
** INDICES_ALL 'watcher__': '__':
* MANAGE
* CREATE_INDEX
* INDEX
* READ
* WRITE
* DELETE

....

2. Reinitialize Search Guard afterwards, for example 
....

elasticsearch-5.4.0$ ./plugins/search-guard-5/tools/sgadmin.sh -cd
plugins/search-guard-5/sgconfig/ -icl -ts config/truststore.jks -ks
config/keystore.jks -h localhost -p 9300 -nhnv ``` ---
