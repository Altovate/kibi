=== Wizard

SIREN ALERT provides a built-in wizard to assist forming proper watchers
using a _step-by-step_ sequence

[[step-1-new-watcher]]
Step 1: New Watcher
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first step is to give our Watcher a name and choose an execution
frequency

Step 2: Input Query
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The input query is the focal part of
our watcher. Make sure time-range fields are dynamic.

Step 3: Condition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Condition is used as a gate to validate if the results
received back are worth processing.

Step 4: Transform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Our data might need adjustments or post processing. Process our payload using a
javascript expression/script.

Step 5: Actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Our data is ready! Let's form a notification using the mustache templating language

Step 6: Expert Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here's our fully formed SIREN ALERT JSON watcher in its naked beauty...
