=== Siren Investigate Changes

Fixed: 

* Fixed a bug in relational buttons that would remove parts of the state if a request from the button was null.
* Completely refactored how automatically generated buttons are rendered to handle the number of requests sent on dashboard navigation.
* Fixed 'Hide Borders' function. It now hides the borders....

Changed:

* Now the upgrade command backs up the configuration index by default.
* Removed some redundant advanced settings (e.g. `siren:zoom`).
* JDBC datasources have been removed from the `management/saved_objects` page.

==== Plugins

[float]
===== Graph Browser

Improved: 

* Optimized edge-count strategy, reducing time spent on `expand` actions by half, in some cases.
* Rewrote the logic to compute counts for nodes. Big speed up, no more missing relations.
* Now supports nodes with millions of relations.

[float]
===== Access Control

Added: 

* Added `admin.ssl.keyPassphrase` option to searchguard ssl options.

[float]
===== Multichart

Fixed: 

* Fixed bug in Next arrow where it would return to the beginning of the list each time.

[float]
===== Gremlin Server

Fixed:

* Siren Gremlin Server now checks that an index mapping exists before trying to fetch the mapping. This prevents a non-blocking error report on startup with no index-pattern.
