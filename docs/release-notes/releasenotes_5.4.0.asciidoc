==== Security fixes
An Open Redirect vulnerability has been fixed with the short URL feature.
Previously, a malicious user could use the internal API that powers the short
URL feature to create a short URL in kibana that redirected to a different
domain. +
{security}[ESA-2016-08] ({commit}92ae3ae[92ae3ae])

Kibana 5.0.0 and 5.0.1 were making requests to advanced settings and the short
URL service on behalf of the kibana server rather than the current user, which
means that being authenticated at all was sufficient to have both read and
write access to the advanced settings and short URLs. +
Kibana 5.0.2 now authenticates requests for each service on behalf of the
current user. +
{security}[ESA-2016-10] ({pull}9214[#9214])

When previous versions of Kibana 5 are configured for SSL client access, file
descriptors will fail to be cleaned up after certain requests and will
accumulate over time until the process crashes. Requests that are canceled
before data is sent can also crash the process. +
{security}[ESA-2017-02] ({pull}10225[#10225])
