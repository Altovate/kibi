== Relations

In this panel, you can define relationships between index patterns. These
relationships ultimately form a **graph** of index patterns. This graph is used
in conjunction with the Vanguard plugin, allowing to perform join operations
between **dashboards**, i.e., filtering a dashboard's documents with regards to
an other.

=== Graph of Index Patterns

A relationship is defined as a **join** operation between two indices with the
following fields:

- _Left Index Pattern_: the left index of the join;
- _Left Type_: the type of the left index of the join;
- _Left Field_: the field of the left index to join on;
- _Right Index Pattern_: the right index of the join;
- _Right Type_: the type of the right index of the join;
- _Right Field_: the field of the right index to join with; and
- _Label_: the label of the relation.

The image below displays a graph of four index patterns, where three
relationships have defined. You can add a new relationship by clicking on the
"_Add relation_" button.

A relation is also indicated on the <<index-patterns,Index Patterns>> Management application thanks
to the icon image:images/relations_settings/index_relation_icon.png["Index
relation icon"].  If you hover the mouse over it, a tooltip message is
displayed indicating the index pattern and field that field is joined with.

For example, in the image below, that icon is displayed next to the field "id"
of the "investor" index, which is join with the field "investorid" of the
"investment" index.
